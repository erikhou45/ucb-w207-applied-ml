    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

Due to the fact that in such a giant feature space, all observations are very far from each other. No obvious clusters associated with labels. Plus, by just doing the raw count, the common uninformative words like 'is', 'are', 'were' etc... will wash out the effect of important words associated with labels.\n",

The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",

    "The TfidfVectorizer(term frequency times inverse document frequency) is a vectorizer that takes into consideration not only the frequency of a term appearing in the training corpus, but how often it appears in different documents in the corpus. When vectorizing the training data, it penalizes the terms having high frequency everywhere across the training data since those words shouldn't be given mush weights in training the classifier because they are not strongly associated with a particular label. \n",
    "\n",
    "The score of a term for a particular example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency in the example times IDF, where IDF = log[n/df(t)] + 1, n = total number of examples, df(t)= the number of documents in which the term appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "I built the model that is fitted to the vocabulary vectorized by TfidfVectorizer and predicted the dev data. Examined the three examples having highest R values. For each example, a table that has the features and its relevant information is generated. The table is sorted by the difference between feature's input into the one vs all regression model used by the predicted label and the true label; therefore, the bigger the difference, the more that feature is driving the model towards the prediction and away from the true label.\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed a few things in the three examples that had high R values and some suggestions for further steps to address the issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* These are typically the documents that includes some key words for the predicted labels but not having enough words associated with the true label. If those words happen to have high idf, such as ftp (example 2 and 3) and children(example 1), they can drive the prediction in the wrong direction quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross reference the confusion matrix generated, we see that the model does a decent job predicting label 1 and 2, but struggles to predict label 3 correctly. It's also the case that we have the least training data on label three. Though TF-IDF already gives more weights to words that appear less which helps the minority class in our training data, I think adding more training data might help with the overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I think it might also help if we take out some words that drives the model away from label 3, such as ftp since the model performs very well in predicting label 1 already.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some stop words that doesn't contain label specific information such as, \"by\", \"were\", and \"any\" were found to have big impact on the predictions in both directions (it drives the predictions to and from the true label when they don't seem to have clear semantic relationship with the labels). By taking them out, it may improve performance.\n"
